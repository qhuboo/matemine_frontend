      'As an extension of one of the most long-running television series of all time, The X-Files, play through the eyes of Special Agent Craig Willmore, a new FBI field investigator brought in to locate missing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully whose last location was the Everett, Washington, area. In this "movie quality" video production, characters are played by the actors and actresses from the show, including Gillian Anderson (Scully) and David Duchovny (Mulder).\nAs the game begins, you are given a briefing of your mission. Gather up all state-of-the-art spy tools (night vision goggles, a digital camera, PDA, lock picks, evidence kit, a standard issue revolver, handcuffs and badge) and then head out to follow their trail. As you explore the various locations, take photographs, pick up pieces of evidence and talk with people. Use your Newton PDA to access the navigational map, to make notes and send/receive e-mail. Trace telephone numbers, run background checks and license plate ids and even post an All Points Bulletin on missing persons using the computer network at your home or office. By using photo viewer software, download field photographs to the computer where they can be enlarged and studied more closely for clues.\nFeatures include emotion icons for interjecting different tones during conversations (mean, humorous or technical) which effect the answer given. An in-game hint system, Artificial Intelligence, can be set on or off. In addition, there are multiple endings as a direct result of actions you take.',

      "The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet. Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? \nWing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. \nThe 3D space combat has you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. \nWhen the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree has both winning and losing paths.",

    description:
      "Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.\nAs you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.\nThere are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.\nCombat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.\nThere are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.",

These items are sent back in time to you in order to change the result of the war by using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.\nThe game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.\nAn \"Extended Collector's Edition\" of the game was released in 2018.

      "<p>A young boy named Link was raised in the village of the elf-like Kokiri people. One day a fairy named Navi introduces him to the village's guardian, the Great Deku Tree. It appears that a mysterious man has cursed the tree, and Link is sent to the Hyrule Castle to find out more. Princess Zelda tells Link that Ganondorf, the leader of the Gerudo tribe, seeks to obtain the Triforce, a holy relic that grants immense power to the one who possesses it. Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule.</p>\n<p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> is the first 3D installment of the Legend of Zelda series. Like most of its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Gameplay is similar to the previous games, allowing Link to explore the world and complete dungeons to obtain key items and advance the plot. Sword combat as well as many familiar items such as boomerang, bombs, the series' currency (rupees) of various values, heart containers, and their collectible fragments permanently increasing Link's health, etc., return in this installment. Link can now lock on enemies for melee and ranged combat, actively use a shield to deflect projectiles, as well as use various magic items. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games. Link can climb certain surfaces, dive underwater, as well as automatically jump.</p>\n<p>The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on, an adult Link becomes a playable character as well. Each of them has certain unique abilities: for example, only adult Link can use a bow and arrows, but only the child Link can crawl through narrow spaces. During the course of the game, the player obtains the Ocarina of Time. Learning and playing melodies on that ocarina is needed to advance the plot, complete certain side quests, or travel in time, switching between the two versions of Link. It is also possible to befriend and ride a horse named Epona to facilitate travel between areas.</p>",

Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to the Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called "GoldenEye", the organization attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It\'s up to our Agent 007 to venture to the Soviet Union once again and to put an end to Janus\' ambitions.</p>\n<p>In this 3D action game, the player controls James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate his foes. However, many parts require the player to be careful, to stay unnoticed, or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to his presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in most of them Bond will have to perform other tasks besides killing his enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options and three difficulty levels. Higher difficulty means, besides having to deal with tougher enemies, additional objectives needed to be fulfilled in order to successfully complete the level.</p>',

      "<p>Mario is invited to Peach's castle, but when he arrives Peach is nowhere to be seen. He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach.</p>\n<p><em>Super Mario 64</em> is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles, and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas. </p>\n<p>Mario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps, and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>Power-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.</p>",

Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.</p>\n<p>The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action.

      "<p><em>Mario Kart 64</em> races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. </p>\n<p>The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.</p>",

      "<p>WCW/NWO Revenge puts the power of the biggest, baddest and meanest wrestlers around the world in the hands of the player. There are more than 60 real and fictional wrestlers - including then-superstars Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Raven and Goldberg - to choose from to square off in the ring in any of several modes of play. </p>\n<p>Each wrestler has an extensive list of moves they are able to perform, although certain physical attributes can affect the availability of certain actions - such as a heavyweight not being able to perform a moonsault from the top ropes, or a cruiserweight not being able to power bomb a larger opponent. The engine is based upon a B-button strike and A-button grapple system. Holding the respective button results in a 'heavy' strike or grapple. Finishing off an opponent generally involves performing your wrestler's special move on them, which can be executed with the flick of the control stick once the wrestler has filled his Spirit Meter, and will be followed with a TV-style instant replay. Depending on the match settings set beforehand, a player can find hidden weapons from the crowd, be assisted or double-teamed by a run-in interference or make his opponent tap out with a submission hold.</p>\n<p>There are several match types and game modes, all of which can take place in a number of arenas designed after the current WCW pay-per-view events of the time. New to the series is a 40-man battle royal, allowing for 4 players or computer-controlled wrestlers to square off in the ring at a time until one is pinned or submitted; at which point they are replaced by a new entrant, continuing on and on until up to 40 wrestlers have entered. The main focus of single-player wrestling revolved around the championship mode, in which a player chooses a wrestler and a championship belt to compete for - beginning with the TV Title on up to the WCW World Championship. After defeating a successive series of opponents, the player then goes toe-to-toe with the current holder of the belt for possession of the championship; upon victory a new wrestler and new championship is unlocked. 1-4 player exhibition matches can be set to play out with an assortment of various settings and rules - such as 2 vs. 1 handicaps, no-disqualifications and tag team battles.</p>\n<p>The game automatically tracks and saves to the battery the stats and arcade-style scores accrued across the various game modes. Also available to the player is a costume editing feature, allowing for quick color changes to full-on wardrobe conversions for each wrestler.</p>\n<p>Revenge was a refinement of the engine seminal wrestling house AKI developed for WCW/NWO World Tour. It would be their final WCW game, as the developer moved on and converted their engine to the WWF license with their next release.</p>",

The gameplay is similar to that of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3634/wcwnwo-revenge/">WCW/NWO Revenge</a>, adding new features such as cage matches, custom entrances, and the possibility to create and customize player\'s own wrestlers.</p>\n<p>The game features more than fifty real WWF stars, as well as the option for sixteen custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. Another addition is the "Road to Wrestlemania" mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a twelve-month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</p>',

      "<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> is the first of many games starring Sega's premier hedgehog, Sonic. It's a side-scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. </p>\n<p>The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. </p>\n<p>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. </p>\n<p>The game is divided into several \"zones\", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone, Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight.</p>",

      '<p><em>Sonic and Knuckles</em> continues the story directly from where <a href="/search/?q=010086010794">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> left off. The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island\'s Mushroom Hills. Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power. Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik\'s plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles? Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he\'s attacked by one of Robotnik\'s robots! He quickly begins a chase for revenge.</p>\n<p><em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> is the fourth game in the Sonic series. It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in <em>Sonic 3</em> (Fire, Water and Electric). Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna. Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air. If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it. He can also break through walls that Sonic can\'t. With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Sonic 3</em>, <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in <a href="/search/?q=4974365540883">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>. These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings. The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses. If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends. The other type of bonus stage is the "Special Stage" seen in <em>Sonic 3</em>, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves. If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.</p>\n<p>A unique feature of the <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> cart is the ability to "Lock-On" previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top. Adding <em>Sonic 3</em> will combine both <em>Sonic 3</em> and <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> levels. Plugging in <em>Sonic 2</em> lets players use Knuckles in <em>Sonic 2</em>, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities. Finally, plugging in the original <a href="/search/?q=010086010091">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage. Subsequent re-releases of <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> have also included most of these bonus features.</p>',

      "<p>Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own way, five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.</p>\n<p>The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has its own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally, at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such as a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.</p>",

      '<p>A millennium has passed since Alis defeated the ultimate evil in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/8194/phantasy-star/"> first Phantasy Star</a>. The planet Motavia of the Algol solar system is no longer the antlion-plagued desert: humans have constructed a sentient computer called "Mother Brain", which could regulate the climate of the planet, turning it into a thriving utopia. One night, a young Motavian government agent named Rolf awakens in his bed after having a nightmare. He sees a young girl fighting a demon, but he is unable to help her. Shortly afterwards, he learns that dangerous bio-monsters have broken free from the laboratories, and is sent there to retrieve a recorder that might contain valuable information about the terrible incident...</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the game is a party-based Japanese RPG with randomly appearing enemies and turn-based combat. Eight characters can join the quest and can be swapped at will to participate in a combat party of four. Characters can equip a wide variety of weapons, including firearms; dual wielding is also possible. Various techniques which require "TP" (technique points, equivalent to magic points in comparable games) are learned by different characters at specific levels. Unlike the first game, <em>Phantasy Star II</em> utilizes the same top-down view for both navigation and dungeon exploration; the now-2D dungeons are notable for their complexity.</p>',

Dr. Brown extracted four Mystical Gems, the android's power source, and sealed them on one of the planet's moons, where it was guarded by the four Gunstar siblings. However, years later, a dictator named Smash Daisaku kidnapped Gunstar Green and brainwashed him into telling him where the Mystical Gems were. The dictator is now close to reactivating Golden Silver. The Gunstar twins Red and Blue, guided by their sister Yellow, must find a way to stop Smash Daisaku - but they know that their older brother is on that way...</p>\n<p><em>Gunstar Heroes</em> is a fast-paced side-scrolling shooter. Controlling either Red or Blue Gunstar, the player has access to four basic weapons: Force, rapid shot; Lightning, a straight shot that penetrates enemies; Chaser, a homing weapon; and Flame, a powerful close-ranged. The player can combine two weapons to produce a new one, for a total of fourteen weapons. It is also possible to use melee attacks and moves such as grabbing and tossing enemies, jumping, and sliding.</p>",

The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.</p>\n<p>To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</p>',

      '<p>Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which nearly cost him the love of his life, Annette, and her sister, Maria. Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, Dracula\'s castle has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power and enters into the castle to find some answers and confront his father.</p>\n<p><em>Symphony of the Night</em> is a direct sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/16246/castlevania-rondo-of-blood/">Rondo of Blood</a>. Unlike the previous installments of the series, the game is set in a castle which the player can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels, and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields, and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.</p>\n<p>The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. The iOS and Android versions are based on the version found in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/30983/castlevania-the-dracula-x-chronicles/">Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles</a> release (has the Saturn versions familiars and items). All the other releases are based on the PlayStation version and do not feature these changes.</p>',

      "<p>The seventh installment of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series takes place in a post-modern, steampunk, sci-fi world where high technology reigns and where robots and bio-engineered mutants co-exist with humans and dragons.</p>\n<p>The story focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world's high technology. Shinra supports this technology with Mako Energy, Shinra's patented source of power. Unfortunately, Mako is the lifeblood of the living planet and by using it up Shinra is slowly upsetting the balance of nature.</p>\n<p>In comes AVALANCHE, a rebel group of disenfranchised citizens who have taken it upon themselves to oppose Shinra's ambitions. The main character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst-ridden fellow with a complex history that is explained as the game goes on. Cloud joins up with AVALANCHE as a mercenary for hire, and together they take on Shinra's maniacal executives and their army of shock-troops, robots, and mutants. However, after a while, it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> is a role-playing game in Japanese style, featuring turn-based combat with a real-time (ATB, \"active time battle\") element against randomly appearing enemies. Customization in the game revolves around a so-called \"Materia\" system. Instead of magic spells, abilities, and bonus stats being saved to a single character, they are saved to Materia orbs, allowing the player to change a character's spells and abilities from the equipment menu at any time. Materia orbs can be bought in stores or found during exploration. The series' trademark summoned monsters are also contained within specific Materia. Besides experience points, characters also receive ability points that gradually upgrade the abilities of the currently equipped Materia.</p>\n<p>Each character also possesses a set of unique attacks called \"Limit Breaks\". By sustaining enough damage without dying a character will build up their Limit Gauge, which can be expended to do a highly damaging attack when filled. More powerful Limit Breaks are unlocked as previous ones are used, and acquiring the most powerful Limit Break of each character will require the completion of sub-quests. </p>\n<p>The game utilizes 3D character models and pre-rendered backgrounds with varying camera angles for the exploration of towns and hostile areas. World map navigation and battle screens are done completely in 3D. CG movies are frequently used as cutscenes that advance the game's story. The game features a large number of mini-games (most of which are optional) and many ways to explore the game world, as the player gradually acquires various vehicles that can venture into previously inaccessible locations.</p>",

      "<p>Even though Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were able to destroy the Umbrella corporation's undead monsters in the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1195/resident-evil/\">Resident Evil</a>, Umbrella's experiments with the T-virus continued unhindered. Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated and trapped inside the city by a car crash. Seeking refuge within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City. </p>\n<p>Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teenage girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. Each character will also be pursued by one seemingly unstoppable foe: a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the \"G-Type\" (Leon's Scenario), or a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X (Claire's Scenario). </p>\n<p>Like the previous game in the series, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Leon will team up with a mysterious woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. </p>\n<p>Unlike the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn't choose, with new locations, maps, enemies, a longer and more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally, ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren't given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</p>",

Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.</p>\n<p>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, <em>Grand Theft Auto 2</em> only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.</p>\n<p>Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.</p>\n<p>New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</p>\n<p>On the PC version the player can change the time of day from noon to dusk to allow for more moody lighting. On the PlayStation the game can only be played at noon, and on the Dreamcast only at dusk.</p>",

Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC\'s "It\'s Tricky" to play. </p>\n<p>Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</p>',

Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and as his power builds he transforms into a demon state where he can use his power against evil he encounters.</p>\n<p>Commencing his battle against the demonic legions with just a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Dante will soon come across more powerful weapons, such as a shotgun to aid him in his mission. However, to defeat the devil Dante must also discover special weapons possessing various elemental powers. When channelled correctly these weapons will allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and launch powerful attacks against a range of enemies.</p>",

      "<p>Humanity is in the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant which has been wiping out colony after colony. Your hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol makes a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin, and function with the Covenant on their heels. Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.</p>\n<p><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.</p>\n<p>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on backup. There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.</p>\n<p>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item that is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single-player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies. Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.</p>\n<p><em>Halo</em> also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.</p>",

The most significant is a new short scenario called <em>Born from a Wish</em>, where players take control of Maria from her first moments right up to where she first appears in the main game. Also included is a sixth ending to the main scenario and a minor feature that allows the player to turn off the graphical effect, which makes the game look like it was shot on cheap film stock.</p>',
